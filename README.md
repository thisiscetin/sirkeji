## â˜± Sirkeji

Sirkeji is a lightweight, in-memory event streaming library for Go, designed to enable modular, event-centric architectures by allowing components to produce and consume events seamlessly. Named after the historic Sirkeci Train Station as a hub of activity, Sirkeji promotes a decoupled and predictable flow of interactions. It eliminates tightly coupled dependencies and excessive side effects, simplifying maintenance and extensibility while delivering high performance without needing external message brokers.
