Sirkeji is a lightweight, in-memory event streaming library for Go designed to enable modular, event-centric architectures by allowing components to produce and consume events seamlessly.

Named after the historic Sirkeci Train Station, Sirkeji promotes a decoupled and predictable flow of interactions. It eliminates tightly coupled dependencies and simplifies extensibility without the performance overhead of external message brokers.
